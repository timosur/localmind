# LocalMind

LocalMind is an local LLM Chat App fully compatible with the Model Context Protocol.
It uses Azure OpenAI as a LLM backend and you can connect it to all MCP Servers out there.

## Development

To work on the frontend in browser with the python backend up and running:

```bash
./dev.sh frontend-dev
```

To run the Tauri App in development mode with the python backend:

```bash
./dev.sh app-dev
```

## Important

Currently only works with Azure OpenAI Service.
